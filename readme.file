Remember to save the script to a file, e.g., setup_wordpress_stack.sh, and make it executable with the following command:
chmod +x setup_wordpress_stack.sh
You can then run the script with root privileges:
sudo ./setup_wordpress_stack.sh
After running the script, you can view the credentials by opening the wordpress_credentials.txt file:
cat /root/wordpress_credentials.txt
